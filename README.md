Introduction

Dimensionality reduction is a crucial step in machine learning and data visualization, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data. This repository focuses on two powerful techniques:

    PCA (Principal Component Analysis): A linear dimensionality reduction technique that projects data onto the directions of maximum variance.

    t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): A non-linear technique particularly well-suited for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.
